    My name is Chris Tran. I am a software engineer based in Houston, Texas. I also have a background in Information Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems.

    I am always ready to learn new technologies and frameworks that are steadily coming out in the future. When I'm not coding, I love to go bouldering or rock climbing.

    Some of the technologies I have worked with include JavaScript, React, React Native, NodeJS, Express, Python, PostgreSQL, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and HTML/CSS.
